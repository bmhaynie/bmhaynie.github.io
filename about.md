High Branch Brewing Co. is a family owned brewery located in Concord, North Carolina, approximately 30 minutes north of Uptown Charlotte.

We consider ourselves to be a lighthearted, fun and quality driven brewery. Our operation is one that concentrates on fermentation and the characteristics that this step in the brewing process can produce. We like to push the limits on what beer can taste like without overdoing it. At High Branch Brewing Co. we feel that fermentation has the greatest affect on the flavor of the finished beer, and therefore that is what we focus on.

We understand that our approach is unique but we must give credit where credit is due. We are constantly studying, taking notes and gathering information from other brewers who share our passion. We understand that we are following in the footsteps of the many before us who have laid the groundwork for a great craft beer market around the world.


Our business is owned and operated by us, TJ and Maureen Creighton. We have the support of our family and friends who have really made the start of this business possible for us. At High Branch Brewing Co. our goal is to bring the community together while being able to share our craft. We look to use local ingredients where possible, and we want to develop relationships with local farmers and businesses.

We believe that quality is the number one goal and with this goal in mind it is important to remember that we are offering a service to you. We greatly appreciate your interest in our beer and what we are offering.
